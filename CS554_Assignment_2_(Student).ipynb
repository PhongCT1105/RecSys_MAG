        "\n",
        "In this assignment, you will continue working with Gemma-3-1B, the same model we used for the previous assignment, but now applied in a more realistic setting where retrieval is essential. Instead of SQuAD-style QA with answering short, factoid questions directly from the model, we will shift to a domain-specific question answering using the BioASQ dataset, which consists of complex questions and information dense answers, making it closer to real-world scientific Q&A in a field like medicine where answers must be near-perfect.\n",

        "Though you can use your own laptop if GPUs are available, we strongly encourage using Google Colab on the L4 GPU. If the session is inactive for a certain period, **the runtime will disconnect**, and there's a very good chance **you will lose your progress**.\n",

N-Glycolylneuraminic acid (Neu5Gc) can be incorporated in human cells and can trigger immune response, a response that is diverse and polyclonal. As dietary Neu5Gc is primarily found in red meat and milk products, it is suggested that this ongoing antigen-antibody reaction may generate chronic inflammation, possibly contributing to the high frequency of diet-related carcinomas and other diseases in humans.\n",

        "In this task, you will complete and test a full RAG pipeline on the BioASQ dataset. Starting from hybrid retrieval (dense + BM25), you’ll add two RAG variants—cross-encoder reranking and contextual compression—to improve evidence quality. You’ll then generate answers constrained to the retrieved context, implement an adaptive retry policy for refusals, and finally compare the pipeline’s outputs against a simple baseline. This exercise shows how each component contributes to moving from noisy retrieval toward more accurate, faithful biomedical QA."
